# Menu Video Background

Allows you to add a high quality background video of any length to the menu/title screen
**Install FFmpeg and add it to your environment variables for this mod to work**

(May cause a bit of lag but it wasn't too noticeable on my end)
(also not really sure why the preview is slowed down lol, it was ok when i was recording it)
